\textbf{Section A (1 Mark Each)}

1. Find the polynomial whose sum and product of zeroes are $-6$ and $5$ respectively.

2. Find the distance of the point from its starting point if a person travels $15\,\text{m}$ west and then $8\,\text{m}$ north.

3. If $PA$ and $PB$ are tangents from an external point $P$ to a circle with centre $O$ and $\angle PAB=50^\circ$, find $\angle AOB$.

4. A ladder reaches a point $D$ on a vertical pole $AB$ of height $6\,\text{m}$. The ladder is inclined at an angle of $60^\circ$ with the horizontal and $AD=2.54\,\text{m}$. Find the length of the ladder. (Use $\sqrt{3}=1.73$)

\textbf{Section B (2 Marks Each)}

5. If $-5$ is a root of the quadratic equation $2x^2+px-15=0$, find the value of $p$. Also find the value of $k$ if $p(x^2+x)+k=0$ has equal roots.

6. Find the coordinates of the points which trisect the line segment joining the points $(2,-2)$ and $(-7,4)$.

7. Prove that a parallelogram circumscribing a circle is a rhombus.

8. Find the area of a triangle whose vertices are $A(3,0)$, $B(6,4)$ and $C(-1,3)$. Also, determine whether the triangle is isosceles right-angled.

9. If the $4^{\text{th}}$ term of an A.P. is zero, prove that the $25^{\text{th}}$ term of the A.P. is three times the $11^{\text{th}}$ term.

10. If $TP$ and $TQ$ are tangents to a circle with centre $O$ from an external point $T$, prove that $\angle PTQ=2\angle OPQ$.

\textbf{Section C (3 Marks Each)}

11. In a right-angled triangle $ABC$, right-angled at $A$, $AB=12\,\text{cm}$ and $AC=5\,\text{cm}$. Find the area of the shaded region formed by the semicircle drawn on the hypotenuse and the triangle.

12. A hemispherical tank of diameter $3\,\text{m}$ is full of water. It is being emptied by a pipe at the rate of $3\frac{4}{7}\,\text{litres/sec}$. How long will it take to empty half of the tank?

13. Find the sum of all three-digit natural numbers which are divisible by $7$.

14. The angle of elevation of the top of a building from the foot of a tower is $30^\circ$ and the angle of elevation of the top of the tower from the foot of the building is $60^\circ$. If the tower is $50\,\text{m}$ high, find the height of the building.

15. Prove that $bx=ay$ if the point $P(x,y)$ is equidistant from the points $A(a+b,b-a)$ and $B(a-b,a+b)$.
